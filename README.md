## This is where we develop our webpage: 

* To see our rendered page go here: [https://datlas-ocean.github.io/index.html](https://datlas-ocean.github.io/index.html).


* To modify the content of the website: 
    * Edit the given page in the `Pages` directory,
    * New images should be uploaded in the  `images` directory,
    * New blog entries (for the "news" section) should be added in the `Blog` directory,
    * Any other change in the other directories should be made with caution and with a pull request, to avoid corrupting the website template.
    * The modifications can take a few minutes to render on the website. Be patient and don't forget to refresh your browser!
